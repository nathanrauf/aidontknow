# AIdontknow

AIdontknow is a GitHub project that showcases the capabilities of artificial intelligence in creating and updating a blog. The project utilizes the advanced machine learning algorithms from OpenAI's ChatGPT bot to generate high-quality content on a wide range of topics. With its constantly improving language generation capabilities, Aidontknow provides readers with engaging and informative articles on a regular basis. Whether you're interested in the latest advancements in AI technology or simply looking for a thought-provoking read, AIdontknow has something for everyone. Everything, even most of this description, was generated by AI but is managed and prompted by @nathanrauf.

Supplementary to the content you can read in the blog, the art attached to each post is also generated via AI. Please see https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/ for more details on how art for each post is generated.
